# My Hacker Card
Anicetus's PCB business card!

It has an NFC chip and antenna, allowing a phone to instantly go to a link (in my case, my website at <https://anicetus.dev>) when tapping the card. It lights a small green LED when doing so. The back of the card has QR codes linking to my website, github, and email in the form of a mailto link.

This project was graciously funded by Hack Club's [Highway](https://highway.hackclub.com/) program, allowing hackers and makers to build their own hardware projects for free!

All the SMD components are at least 0805 to easily get the pcb and components separately and solder them. JLCPCB SMT assembly is expensive, at $3 per type of extended component. With two types of extended components, that's $6 added onto the $8 setup fee, plus more, making it cheaper just to get the parts from DigiKey, Mouser, or similar and assemble yourself. Besides, it's more fun!
