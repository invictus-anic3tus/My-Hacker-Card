### day one - july 18

today i got started making the PCB! it's looking pretty easy with the [guide](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card), but finding what LED i want to use is actually surprisingly difficult. I think i've found a nice green one that's in stock at JLCPCB tho so yay! I'd planned to finish this thing within a day but this stupid LED has held me up a long while. Whatever ig.

oh yeah and also Koji helped me find a different nfc ic that's handsolderable! maybe instead of getting jlc pcba i'll get the parts from lcsc or smth. I did finish the schematic tho!

### day two - july 19

today I worked a bunch more on the pcb layout and stuff, and spent a while trying to make a nice circuit-esque design, but it didn't turn out right. other than that, I made it look pretty sweet! I think I can finish it tmrw.

I've also been wanting to get ENIG for this thing... but for $16 idt that's happening, unfortunately. The gold and black would've looked awesome together.

I think I'm essentially done with the pcb now... I put a little hole in the top left for a keychain or whatever.

### day three - july 20

today i made sure that my pcb + schematic would work, sourced parts on digikey (since they've got warehouses in america, avoiding tariffs and big shipping costs), and got a general outline of the price of getting just a bare PCB from jlcpcb. I wonder, actually, if I could get a local PCB from like OSHPark or whatever and have it be cheaper than JLC, since shipping... probably not to HC because of the $20 coupon actually. lol by this point im brainstorming in my journal. anyways, I composed a BOM and wrote a readme, and put all these journal entries into a GH repo. Noice
