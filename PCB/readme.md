Herein contains the Altium Designer files for this PCB. Note that these were exported with EasyEDA, which for some reason or other I seem to use more often than KiCad, so the files may be imported incorrectly; and if so, please take care to adjust and/or fix the files as according to the schematic and/or PCB images as shown in the root readme file, so that the PCB works correctly. Herein also contains the Gerber files in order to produce the PCB, noting that I have not located JLCPCB components for every part, so I cannot provide BOM or CPL files, meaning you will likely have to hand-solder this, if you're the kind of person who is interested in making other people's business cards.
